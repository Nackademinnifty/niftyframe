                <p>Craftfood is a restaurant that started 2015 in Stockholm. They needed a new webpage with information about their food and philosophy.</p>
                <p> The webpage is responsive and works on every screen size even on mobiles. You can even make reservations on the page..</p>

                <p> We made apps both for android and iOS. The website is also responsive which means that the members doesnâ€™t need to download the app to use the functions.</p>
